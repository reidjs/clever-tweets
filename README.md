## What is clever?

*Within the context of this repo*, "clever tweets" are the ones that make you think, "Good one! Why didn't I think of that?" You will know them when you see them. Everyone will have a different perspective on what is, and is not, funny, clever, humorous, or insightful. Please take a look at the [tweets](./tweets/) to find some examples of clever tweets. You may have a different definition of clever, that's great! Please add some tweets that you think are clever by creating a pull request.

It's more important we define what does NOT belong here:

*These types of tweets are not encouraged in this repository*

- Pop culture, politics, or recent news focused, has a very short expiration date.
- Too simple, everyone has already come up with that joke or comment.
- Retweets and tweets with multimedia (photos, videos, links). 
- Hot takes
- Too reliant on knowing the background of the writer or the subject matter. 
- (Create a pull request to add new rules)
